# leagueproject

Nothing very important really. Just a mandatory school project requires very little C experience.


 
# Purpose

  Basically project is a basic league scoreboard calculator and printer. It reads team number from "ayarlar.txt", builds the teams
starting point, played matches, goals allowed and scored etc. as zero, reads teams names from "takimlar.txt" and finally reads matches
from either keyboard or "maclar1.txt". It can print final scoreboard to the file or to the terminal. It can print the scoreboard 
sort by teams points , aliases or alphabetic order.
